			<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

			<h2 id="training-workspace">Training Workspace</h2>
			<p>The concept of a "training" workspace will be referenced throughout this document as a possible solution to a number of different problems.</p>

			This refers to the idea of creating a workspace that is dedicated to training and seperated from other business operations. In such a
			workspace, users would access to all features (except possibly the Account Admin Console), there would be little to no restrictions, and where
			each user is potentially an admin in the workspace. When configured properly, users have the freedom to explore the different concepts presented
			through Databricks Academy's various courses without mingling those activities with those associated to production activities.

			<h2 id="requires-unity-catalog">Requires Unity Catalog</h2>
			There are generally two reasons for this error:
			<ol>
				<li>The first possible reason would be that you are <b>not</b> using an enterprise version of Databricks that supports Unity Catalog.
					In this case a new workspace would need to be provisioned under an E2 Account and then optionally migrate the contents
					of the "classic" workspace to the "E2" workspace. We generally recommend setting up a <a href="#training-workspace">training-workspace</a> separate
					form any production workspaces which address other security concerns but also eliminates the need to perform any type of migration.
				</li>
				<li>
					The second possible reason is that you <b>are</b> using an enterprise version of Databricks that <b>does</b> support Unity Catalog
					but Unity Catalog is not enabled.
				</li>
			</ol>
